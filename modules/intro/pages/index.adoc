:description: Overview of pyTigerGraph.

pyTigerGraph is a Python package for connecting to TigerGraph databases. We offer two versions of the package: _pyTigerGraph_ and _pyTigerGraph[gds]_.

_pyTigerGraph_ is the default version and contains the core functionality of pyTigerGraph, which includes:

* Data manipulation functions: working with vertices and edges (insert/update/upsert, delete
  and retrieve)
* Query functions: running (and managing) queries (â‰ˆ stored procedures) inside the TigerGraph
  database
* Metadata functions: fetching details of graphs/schemas, vertex and edge types, and other
  schema objects and object types
* Authentication and authorization functions
* Miscellaneous/utility functions

The _pyTigerGraph[gds]_ version of pyTigerGraph is a drop-in replacement for _pyTigerGraph_,
but adds support for Graph Data Science and Graph ML capabilities. This includes:

* Graph feature engineering using algorithms from the GSQL Graph Data Science Library
* Dataloaders for training and inference of Graph Neural Network models using PyTorch Geometric and DGL
* Machine learning utilities for splitting
