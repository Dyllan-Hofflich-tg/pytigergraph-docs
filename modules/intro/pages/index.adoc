:description: Overview of pyTigerGraph.

pyTigerGraph is a Python package for connecting to TigerGraph databases. We offer two versions of the package:
`pyTigerGraph` and `pyTigerGraph[gds]`. `pyTigerGraph` is the default version and contains the core functionality of pyTigerGraph, which includes:
* Vertex functions
* Edge functions
* Schema functions
* Query functions
* Miscellaneous functions

The `pyTigerGraph[gds]` version of pyTigerGraph is a drop-in replacement for `pyTigerGraph`, but adds support for Graph Data Science and Graph ML capabilities.
