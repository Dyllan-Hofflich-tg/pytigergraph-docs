= Authentication

If GSQL authentication is enabled in the TigerGraph database, then username and password need to be specified when the connection is established.

If REST++ authentication is enabled, and you already have an API authorization token, specify that one as well.
Alternatively, if you possess a secret (created previously in the database), you can request a token via the getToken function and use it during the session. See Token Management for more details.
