# Release Notes

We are excited to announce the pyTigerGraph v0.9 release! This release adds many new features for graph machine learning and graph data science, a refactoring of core code, and more robust testing. Additionally, we have officially “graduated” it to an official TigerGraph product. This means brand-new documentation, a new GitHub repository, and future feature enhancements. While becoming an official product, we are committed to keeping pyTigerGraph true to its roots as an open-source project. Check out the contributing page and GitHub issues if you want to help with pyTigerGraph’s development.
pyTigerGraph 0.9 was released on May 16th, 2022.

## New Features
### Graph Data Science Capability
Many new capabilities added for graph data science and graph machine learning.

* Data loaders for training Graph Neural Networks in DGL and PyTorch Geometric

* A "featurizer" to generate graph-based features 

* Metric trackers for precision, recall, and accuracy

* Vertex and edge splitters for generation of train/validation/testing splits.

## Other Changes
### Documentation
We have moved the documentation to the https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/intro/[official TigerGraph Documentation site ] and updated many of the contents with type hints and more descriptive parameter explainations.

### Testing
There is now well-defined testing for every function in the package. A more defined testing framework is coming soon.

### Code Structure
A major refactor of the codebase was performed. No breaking changes were made to accompplish this.
