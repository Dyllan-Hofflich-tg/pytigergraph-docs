= GDS Functions
:description: Reference for GDS functions.

Graph Data Science (GDS) functions perform machine learning tasks such as the following:

* Loading data from a TigerGraph database in batches
* Splitting vertices into training, test, and validation sets
* Gathering metrics for Graph Neural Network (GNN) predictions
* Installing and running Graph Data Science algorithms


In order to use the Graph Data Science Functions, make sure that you have installed one of the following pyTigerGraph :

* `pyTigerGraph[gds]`: Will install both `torch_geometric` and `dgl` libraries.
* `pyTigerGraph[gds-pyg]`: Will install `torch_geometric` and its dependencies.
* `pyTigerGraph[gds-dgl]`: Will install `dgl`.
* `pyTigerGraph[gds-lite]`: Will not install a graph machine learning framework.
